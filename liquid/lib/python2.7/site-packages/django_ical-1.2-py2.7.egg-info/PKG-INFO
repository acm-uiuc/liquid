Description: ====================
        django-ical
        ====================
        
        django-ical is a simple library/framework for creating `ical
        <http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2445.txt>`_ feeds based in Django's `syndication
        feed framework
        <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/ref/contrib/syndication/>`_. This
        documentation is modeled after the documentation for the syndication feed
        framework so you can think of it as a simple extension.
        
        If you are familiar with the Django syndication feed framework you should be
        able to be able to use django-ical fairly quickly. It works the same way as
        the Django syndication framework but adds a few extension properties to
        support iCalendar feeds.
        
        django-ical uses the `icalendar <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/icalendar/>`_ library
        under the hood to generate iCalendar feeds.
